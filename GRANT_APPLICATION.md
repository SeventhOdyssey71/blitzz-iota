### Project Summary
BLITZZ is a comprehensive DeFi platform built on IOTA that combines an automated market maker (AMM) DEX, meme token launchpad with bonding curves, and advanced trading features. The platform leverages IOTA's feeless transactions and Move smart contracts to provide users with efficient swaps, liquidity provision, and token creation capabilities, all while maintaining a seamless user experience with accurate blockchain-based calculations and real-time pool discovery.

### Project Description
BLITZZ represents a significant advancement in the IOTA DeFi ecosystem by providing a full-stack decentralized finance solution that addresses key market needs:

**Core Components:**
1. **AMM DEX**: Our decentralized exchange implements a constant product formula with a 0.3% swap fee, enabling efficient token swaps with accurate price calculations based on real-time pool reserves. The system automatically discovers and tracks liquidity pools, ensuring users always get the best rates.

2. **Meme Token Launchpad**: A revolutionary token creation platform with bonding curve mechanics, allowing anyone to launch tokens with just 2 IOTA. Tokens automatically graduate to the main DEX after reaching 4,000 IOTA in liquidity, creating a fair launch environment.

3. **Advanced Trading Features**: Beyond basic swaps, we're implementing limit orders and dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategies, bringing CEX-like functionality to DeFi.

**Why IOTA:**
- **Feeless Transactions**: IOTA's unique architecture eliminates gas fees, making micro-transactions and frequent trading viable
- **Move Smart Contracts**: Provides security and composability for complex DeFi operations
- **Scalability**: IOTA's DAG structure ensures our platform can handle high-frequency trading without congestion
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Contributing to IOTA's expanding DeFi landscape with innovative solutions

**Technical Innovation:**
- Real-time pool discovery and tracking system
- Accurate swap calculations using actual blockchain data
- Seamless wallet integration with IOTA dApp Kit
- Modern UI/UX with React 19 and Next.js 15
- Comprehensive testing suite for smart contracts

### Target Ecosystem

### Tokenomics
**BLITZZ Token (BLTZ) - Governance & Utility Token**

**Token Distribution:**
- **Community Rewards**: 40% (liquidity mining, trading rewards, airdrops)
- **Team & Advisors**: 20% (4-year vesting with 1-year cliff)
- **Treasury**: 15% (protocol development and partnerships)
- **Initial Liquidity**: 10% (DEX liquidity and market making)
- **Strategic Partners**: 10% (ecosystem collaborations)
- **Public Sale**: 5% (fair launch mechanism)

**Token Utility:**
1. **Governance**: Vote on protocol parameters, fee structures, and treasury allocation
2. **Fee Discounts**: Up to 50% reduction in trading fees for BLTZ holders
3. **Revenue Sharing**: Stake BLTZ to earn a portion of protocol fees
4. **Launchpad Access**: Exclusive access to new token launches and guaranteed allocations
5. **Liquidity Incentives**: Boost rewards for liquidity providers

**Token Mechanics:**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 BLTZ
- **Initial Circulating**: 150,000,000 BLTZ (15%)
- **Emission Schedule**: Decreasing inflation over 4 years
- **Burn Mechanism**: 10% of protocol fees used for buyback and burn
- **Staking Rewards**: 20% APY for long-term stakers

**Value Accrual:**
- Protocol fees flow to BLTZ stakers
- Buyback and burn creates deflationary pressure
- Increased utility drives demand
- Network effects from growing user base

**Launch Strategy:**
- Fair launch via bonding curve on our launchpad
- No pre-mine or insider allocation
- Initial liquidity provided by team
- Community-driven price discovery
