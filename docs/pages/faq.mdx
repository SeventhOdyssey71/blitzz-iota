Key differentiators:
- **IOTA Speed**: Sub-second transaction finality
- **Low Fees**: Fraction of a cent per transaction
- **Move Security**: Formally verified smart contracts
- **Full Suite**: Swaps, pools, limit orders, and DCA in one platform

### Is IOTA DeFi audited?

Yes! Our smart contracts have been audited by leading security firms. [View audit reports →](/security)

## Getting Started

### Which wallets are supported?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.8)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  Currently supported wallets:
  
  - **Sui Wallet** (Recommended)
  - **Martian Wallet**
  - **Ethos Wallet**
  - **Suiet Wallet**
  
  All wallets must be configured for the IOTA network.
</div>

### How do I get IOTA tokens?

For mainnet:
1. Purchase IOTA on centralized exchanges
2. Bridge from other chains via official bridges
3. Receive from other IOTA users

For testnet:
1. Visit [IOTA Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.iota.io)
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Receive free test tokens

### What are gas fees like?

IOTA gas fees are extremely low:
- Simple swap: ~0.001 IOTA ($0.001)
- Add liquidity: ~0.002 IOTA ($0.002)
- Complex DCA setup: ~0.005 IOTA ($0.005)

## Trading

### What is slippage?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.1)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  Slippage is the difference between expected and executed price due to:
  
  - Market movements during transaction
  - Large trade impact on pool price
  - Other trades executing first
  
  Set slippage tolerance to protect against unfavorable price changes.
</div>

### Why did my transaction fail?

Common reasons:
1. **Insufficient balance**: Check token amounts and gas
2. **Slippage exceeded**: Increase tolerance or reduce size
3. **Pool imbalance**: Try smaller amount or different pool
4. **Network congestion**: Retry with higher gas

### What are multi-hop swaps?

When no direct pool exists between two tokens, the router finds the best path through intermediate tokens:

```
Token A → IOTA → USDC → Token B
```

This happens automatically and transparently.

## Liquidity Pools

### What is impermanent loss?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.1)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.3)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  <strong>⚠️ Important Concept:</strong>
  
  Impermanent loss occurs when token price ratios change after you provide liquidity. The greater the divergence, the higher the IL.
  
  Example: If one token 2x while the other stays flat, you experience ~5.7% IL.
  
  It's "impermanent" because it only realizes if you withdraw at unfavorable ratios.
</div>

### How are LP rewards calculated?

Rewards come from:
1. **Trading fees**: 0.25% of all swaps
2. **Your pool share**: Percentage of total liquidity
3. **Additional incentives**: If applicable

Formula: `Your Rewards = (Total Fees × Your Pool Share)`

### Can I lose money providing liquidity?

Risks include:
- Impermanent loss if prices diverge
- Smart contract risk (mitigated by audits)
- Token depreciation

However, fee earnings often offset IL over time.

## Limit Orders

### How do limit orders execute?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.8)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  Execution process:
  
  1. You set target price and amount
  2. Order waits in on-chain order book
  3. Keeper network monitors prices
  4. When price is met, keeper executes
  5. You receive tokens at exact price
</div>

### Are there fees for cancelled orders?

No fees for cancellation, only gas costs for the cancel transaction.

### Why hasn't my limit order filled?

Possible reasons:
- Market price hasn't reached your limit
- Insufficient liquidity at your price
- Order expired (if time-limited)
- Gas price too low for keepers

## DCA Strategies

### What happens if a DCA order fails?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.1)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  Failed orders are handled gracefully:
  
  - Strategy continues to next interval
  - Failed order retried if conditions improve
  - No funds are lost
  - You're notified of failures
</div>

### Can I modify an active DCA?

You can:
- ✅ Pause/resume execution
- ✅ Cancel and withdraw funds
- ✅ Add more funds to extend
- ❌ Change tokens or intervals (create new instead)

### What's the minimum DCA amount?

Minimum $10 per order to ensure fee efficiency. No maximum limit.

## Security

### Is IOTA DeFi non-custodial?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.1)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  <strong>✅ Fully Non-Custodial:</strong>
  
  - You control your funds at all times
  - No admin keys can freeze assets
  - Smart contracts are immutable
  - Cancel orders/strategies anytime
</div>

### How are prices determined?

Prices come from:
1. **AMM Pools**: Constant product formula
2. **Aggregation**: Best price across pools
3. **Oracle Feeds**: For price bounds/limits

### What if I send tokens to wrong address?

Unfortunately, blockchain transactions are irreversible. Always:
- Double-check addresses
- Send test transactions first
- Use address book features

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction pending for too long?

1. Check network status
2. Verify gas price is sufficient
3. Try canceling and resubmitting
4. Contact support if persists

### Balance not updating?

- Refresh the page
- Check transaction status on explorer
- Clear browser cache
- Ensure wallet is connected to correct network

### Price impact too high?

<div style={{
  background: 'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.1)',
  border: '1px solid rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.3)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  padding: '16px',
  marginTop: '16px',
  marginBottom: '16px'
}}>
  Solutions for high price impact:
  
  1. **Reduce trade size**: Split into smaller trades
  2. **Use limit orders**: Set desired price
  3. **Check other pools**: May have better liquidity
  4. **Wait for liquidity**: More LPs may join
